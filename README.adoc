= Strider Neo4j Plugin
:neo4j_version: 3.5.14

This plugin contains custom functions and procedures to assist the Strider-Neo4j interface.

[Note]
This plugin is built for Neo4j {neo4j_version}, though it does not depend on any deprecated features.

=== Get Paths

This function allows you to identify whether a subgraph is traversable from a set of labeled nodes, respecting the directions of edges.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[e:abc {kid: 'a1'}]-()

== Building

This project uses maven, to build a jar-file with the function in this
project, simply package the project with maven:
